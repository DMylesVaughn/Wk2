## Wk2 Assignment

- This site was created for a homework assignment.  The assignment was to create a Portfolio page similar to the one displayed in the Module 2 Challenge.

- The technologies used were html and css per the prescribed tools of the assignment.
Html allows us to build the framework of the site, while CSS allows us to style the site as we choose.

- This project was built as a template to add in future work to display as part of my professional profile as a Full Stack Web Developer.

- It provides a single point of reference for potential employers to review my work, resume, and contact me if they would like.

- In this project I learned that research and time have been paramount for me inregards to attempting to meet requirements of projects.
